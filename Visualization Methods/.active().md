<a name="active" href="#wiki-active">#</a> viz.**active**(*string*)

Defines the key in your data associated with the number of "active" parts. This variable should be used in conjunction with [.**total**()](#total") to correctly display fill percentages inside of shapes (such as making each node in a scatter plot a pie chart).

<a name="active-func" href="#wiki-active-func">#</a> viz.**active**(*function*)

You can also pass a function as a method of determining which objects are "active". D3plus will pass your function the data point in question, and the function should return the value requested.

<a name="active-obj" href="#wiki-active-obj">#</a> viz.**active**(*object*)

.**active**() also supports passing a keyed object. Here are the supported keys:

|Key|Description|Accepted Values|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|
|key|Defines the key in your data associated with the number of "active" parts. When passing only a *string* or *function* to the .**active**() function, this is the variable that actually gets set.<br><br>You can also pass a single keyed *object*, keyed by the appropriate nesting level's [.**id**()](#id). This will tell **D3plus** to look in that specific nesting level's attribute list for the .**active**() variable. Additionally, if the *object* you pass to .**active**() does not contain any of the following keys, **D3plus** will use the *object* as this key.|*string*, *function*, *object*, <code>**null**</code>, <code>**false**</code>|<code>**null**</code>|
|mute|Hides specific data points from the viewer. Full documentation can be found [here](Filtering-Data#mute).|**value**, *function*, *array*|<code>**null**</code>|
|solo|Shows only specific data points to the viewer. Full documentation can be found [here](Filtering-Data#solo).|**value**, *function*, *array*|<code>**null**</code>|
|spotlight|Determines the behavior of inactive nodes, based on how the current [Visualization Type](Visualization-Types) handles it. For example, when .**spotlight**() is set to <code>**true**</code> for a [Network](Visualization-Types#wiki-network), all of the "inactive" nodes will be greyed out, giving more emphasis on the "active" nodes.|<code>**true**</code>, <code>**false**</code>|<code>**false**</code>|
