#### <a name="number" href="#number">.margin( *number* )</a>

Defines the pixel margins, on all sides, of the overall element.

#### <a name="string" href="#string">.margin( *string* )</a>

You can also pass a standard **CSS** *string* to define the margin. For example, to set the top and bottom margins to `10` and the left and right margins to `20`, you would pass the following:

`js
.margin( "10px 20px" )
`
